I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, advised by [Prof. Roy Schwartz](https://schwartz-lab-huji.github.io/). My research focuses on interpretability and efficiency in natural language processing.

I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science with honors under the supervision of Prof. Schwartz, and I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science, both from The Hebrew University.
